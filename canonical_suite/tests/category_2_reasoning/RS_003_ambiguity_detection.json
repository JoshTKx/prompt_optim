Optimizer must force explicit enumeration of all ambiguity types including multi-level interactions between prepositional phrase attachments and quantifier scopes, require formal structural analysis with parse trees or logical formulas showing how different parsings yield different meanings, demand explanation of practical financial and regulatory consequences with quantitative impact examples for each interpretation, prevent premature disambiguation based on regulatory custom or industry practice, and ensure recognition that edge cases around temporal boundaries and aggregation methods represent genuine ambiguity rather than mere technicalities.",
