Optimizer must learn to: (1) require systematic evaluation of each safety parameter against engineering standards and regulatory requirements with quantitative risk assessment, (2) mandate identification of ALL critical findings with explicit severity classification and consequence modeling, (3) recognize and flag patterns of systematic safety degradation driven by operational or economic pressures, (4) demand specific corrective actions prioritized by immediacy and consequence severity, (5) require contextual risk assessment incorporating process chemistry, environmental conditions, facility layout, and population exposure, (6) identify compound and cascading failure scenarios where multiple degraded systems create catastrophic risk amplification, (7) ensure zero tolerance for production-driven safety compromises and demand immediate operational changes. The test requires deep domain knowledge integration across process safety engineering, instrumentation, regulatory frameworks, and consequence analysis with absolute intolerance for any missed critical safety violations that could result in loss of life or environmental disaster.",
