Production target is 50K wafers/month starting Q3 2025. They mentioned some export control issues were resolved last year. The fab currently runs at 68% utilization with Samsung and MediaTek as anchor customers. Governance will be 60-40 board structure. Local government offered tax incentives through 2030.",
