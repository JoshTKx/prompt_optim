The transaction includes representations and warranties standard for deals of this magnitude, including material adverse change clauses, indemnification provisions capped at 15% of transaction value, and a 24-month post-closing employment requirement for key executives. Closing is anticipated in Q3 2025 subject to shareholder approval from both companies and customary closing conditions.",

Mediation failed after landlord rejected tenant's settlement offer of $85,000 plus lease termination, and trial is scheduled for eight weeks from today with each party seeking attorney fees under Section 19.3.",

Oceanview Development Corp addresses three core holdings: First, the court reversed the trial court's summary judgment on the negligence claim, finding that a triable issue exists regarding whether the defendant's failure to install guardrails on the elevated walkway constituted a breach of duty, noting the walkway exceeded the 30-inch threshold in Building Code Section 1013.1 requiring protective barriers and that defendant's actual knowledge of prior incidents created a genuine dispute of material fact. Second, the court affirmed dismissal of the premises liability claim because plaintiff was classified as a trespasser rather than invitee, as the construction site was clearly marked with no-trespassing signage and locked gates, and plaintiff's presence was unauthorized regardless of the alleged shortcut used by other workers. Third, the court remanded the punitive damages question for further proceedings, holding that evidence of five previous similar incidents combined with internal emails suggesting cost-benefit analysis of safety measures could support a finding of conscious disregard if a jury credits plaintiff's evidence at trial.",
