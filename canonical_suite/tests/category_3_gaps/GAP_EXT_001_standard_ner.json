Optimizer must specify comprehensive research entity taxonomy (GRANT_NUMBER, FUNDING_AGENCY, PI_ROLE, RESEARCHER, INSTITUTION, DEPARTMENT, FUNDING_AMOUNT, EQUIPMENT, PROTOCOL_NUMBER, REGULATORY_REFERENCE, PUBLICATION_CITATION, EFFORT_ALLOCATION, TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION, COLLABORATION, TIMELINE), provide examples of agency-specific number formats, handle percentage-based affiliations, distinguish current vs previous affiliations, extract nested budget components, recognize international institution formats, and maintain high precision on role-based and regulatory entities.",
