The optimizer must teach the model to: (1) validate temporal consistency before answering, (2) cross-check product/technology existence dates, (3) identify compound impossibilities involving multiple anachronisms, (4) explicitly state why the premise is impossible, and (5) provide educationally valuable corrections with accurate historical context. Simple prompts fail because they don't enforce systematic premise validation against known timelines.",
