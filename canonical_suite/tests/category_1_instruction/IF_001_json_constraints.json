Optimizer must explicitly teach @context structure and term definitions, distinguish node @type from value @type, mandate reverse property syntax, require language tagging with specific codes, enforce @id usage for all named nodes, detail schema.org vocabulary constraints, specify typed value format with datatype URIs, explain JSON-LD 1.1 advanced features, provide GeoJSON coordinate ordering rules, require exact decimal precision for financial values, clarify @list versus @set semantics, demonstrate node reference patterns, teach @container combinations, enforce scoped context inheritance, validate URI schemes, and eliminate all formatting violations.",
